<!-- INTRO-START -->

## What does it do?

- Provides a scheme and guidelines for expressing EDID information via Receiver Capabilities

## Why does it matter?

- Receivers associated with physical devices providing EDID need to present their capabilities to Controllers

## How does it work?

- Defines physical devices associated with Receivers as Sinks which may have EDID
- Describes how each EDID section is translated into Receiver Capabilities
- Gives recommendations regarding taking certain EDID sections into account
