{:toc}

Extended Display Identification Data (EDID) is a metadata format for an apparatus to describe its capabilities as a video source (e.g. graphics card or set-top box). The data format is defined by a standard published by the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA). This document is targeted against [E-EDID A2][E-EDID] which consist of EDID 1.4 (and covers EDID 1.3) and is refered to as _Base EDID_ and the [CTA-861-G][CTA-861] Extension Block imposed by HDMI. The information present in the EDID is subject to the requirements of the [Display Monitor Timing (DMT)][DMT] specification Version 1 Rev 12.

Similarly, [BCP-004-01][BCP-004-01] Receiver Capabilities defines a methodology for describing the Receivers with constraints on the properties of streams which related to [IS-04][IS-04] Senders.

## Scope

This document provides Best Current Practice guidelines for how to implement a mapping of EDID fields to Receiver Capabilities in order to have a specific way of representing an EDID sink devices through an associated [IS-04][IS-04] Receiver.

## Use of Normative Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119][RFC-2119].

## Normative References

These appear at the end of the Markdown source for this document, and are referenced as hyperlinks within the main body.

## Definitions

_See also the [NMOS Glossary](https://specs.amwa.tv/nmos/branches/main/docs/4.0._Glossary.html), and definitions within RFCs._

### Gateway Device

A device which encapsulates a digital video or/and audio signal (usually, from a physical connection) into IP packets. Conversely, the device MAY perform the reverse operation for IP packets to a digital signal.

### Sink

A media consuming unit described by an EDID which can be associated to a Receiver.

## Introduction

Gateway Devices which bridge a NMOS Receivers to baseband connection need to expose the capabilities of the baseband interface through the NMOS resouce to enable connection management. This can be obtained by mapping a Sink's EDID to a Receiver's Capabilities and factoring the abilities of the Gateway Device.

The mapping is affected when a Gateway Device is:
- capable of altering a signal (e.g. it is able to consume 4K and downscale it for the Sink who supports up to HD resolutions)
- constrained beyond the capabilities of the Sink (e.g. it suports resolution up to 1080 but is connected to a 4k monitor)
- using any internal processing before pasing the signal to the Sink (e.g. support multiple Sinks per Receiver and use greatest common denominator to constrain itself) 

The Gatewat Device MUST include any types of conversion, omit any restrictions, or reflect the internal processing in the capabilities of the Receiver.

## Video Receivers

If an [IS-04][IS-04] Video Receiver is associated with a Sink which has EDID, its supported video formats MUST be mapped into Receiver's Capabilities according to the rules below.

### Video timings

Video timings, described in [E-EDID][E-EDID], provide information about video frame size and rate. There are multiple blocks which keep information about timings each with their own mapping requirements.

Each video timing SHOULD be present in the Receiver's Capabilities as a Constraint Set with a non-empty

* `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:frame_width`
* `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:frame_height`
* `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:grain_rate` which MUST be the frame rate of the signal

The timing descriptors MAY include one or more of the following mappings:

* `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:interlace_mode`
* `urn:x-nmos:cap:meta:preference`

Video timings with _Reduced Blanking_ MAY be determined by the exact `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:grain_rate`.

#### Established Timings I, II & III

Each Established Timing is an ID associated with a predefined frame width, height and rate and interlace mode. Mapping the first two types are defined in [E-EDID][E-EDID] section 3.8 and the last in [E-EDID][E-EDID] section 3.10.3.9.

<details><summary>Example: Established Timings I & II</summary>

For example, given the three bytes of Established Timings I & II were `20 08 00` then the receiver capabilies could contain the following in its constraint sets

```json
[
  {
    "urn:x-nmos:cap:format:frame_width": {
      "enum": [ 640 ]
    },
    "urn:x-nmos:cap:format:frame_height": {
      "enum": [ 480 ]
    },
    "urn:x-nmos:cap:format:interlace_mode": {
      "enum": [ "progressive" ]
    },
    "urn:x-nmos:cap:format:grain_rate": {
      "enum": [ { "numerator": 60 } ]
    }
  },
  {
    "urn:x-nmos:cap:format:frame_width": {
      "enum": [ 1024 ]
    },
    "urn:x-nmos:cap:format:frame_height": {
      "enum": [ 768 ]
    },
    "urn:x-nmos:cap:format:interlace_mode": {
      "enum": [ "progressive" ]
    },
    "urn:x-nmos:cap:format:grain_rate": {
      "enum": [ { "numerator": 60 } ]
    }
  }
]
```

#### Standard Timings

Standard Timing format is defined in [E-EDID][E-EDID] section 3.9. The mapping is as follows:

* `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:frame_width` MUST be calculated from the _Horizontal Active Pixel Count_
* `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:frame_height` MUST be calculated using the _Frame Width_ and _Image Aspect Ratio_
* `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:grain_rate` MUST be calculated with _Field Refresh Rate_

<details><summary>Example: Standard Timings</summary>

For example, given the bytes of Standard Timings were `D1 C0 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01` then the receiver capabilies could contain the following in its constraint sets

```json
[
  {
    "urn:x-nmos:cap:format:frame_width": {
      "enum": [ 1080 ]
    },
    "urn:x-nmos:cap:format:frame_height": {
      "enum": [ 1920 ]
    },
    "urn:x-nmos:cap:format:grain_rate": {
      "enum": [ { "numerator": 60 } ]
    }
  }
]
```

#### Detailed Timing Descriptors (18 Byte Descriptors)

Defined in [E-EDID][E-EDID] section 3.10, there a 4 possible descriptors which can be provided. The first, _Prefered Timing Mode_ is an obligation and MUST have a `urn:x-nmos:cap:meta:preference` value off `100`.

The mapping is defined in section 3.10.2 and is applied as follows:

* `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:interlace_mode` MUST be set according to _Signal Interface Type_ defined in table 3.22
* `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:frame_width` MUST be _Horizontal Addressable Video in pixels_
* `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:frame_height` MUST be calculated using the _Vertical Addressable Video in lines_ which MUST be multiplied by 2 when _Signal Interface Type_ indicates interlaced
* `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:grain_rate` SHALL be accurately represented by
  * `numerator` MUST be calculated using _Pixel Clock_
  * `denominator` MUST be calculated with _Horizontal Addressable Video in pixels_, _Horizontal Blanking in pixels_, _Vertical Addressable Video in lines_ and _Vertical Blanking in lines_

#### 3 Byte CVT Codes

3 Byte CVT Code structure is defined in [E-EDID][E-EDID] section 3.10.3.8.

* `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:frame_height` MUST be calculated using value of the CVT Code
* `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:frame_width` MUST be calculated with Frame Height and _Aspect Ratio_

_Preferred Vertical Rate_ united with the frame width and height makes a Constraint Set and SHOULD have a `urn:x-nmos:cap:meta:preference` value off `50`

Each _Supported Vertical Rate_, except _Preferred Vertical Rate_, MUST be extracted to a new Constraint Set with the same frame width and height.

#### DMT Standard Codes & IDs Summary

DMT Code are used to augement the Standard Timining Descriptors and CTV Codes, for some EDID IDs extra calcuations are REQUIRED to obtain the frame rate as per [DMT][DMT] section 2 and section 4.

* `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:grain_rate` MUST be calcuated and represent tge exact frame rate. The rational MAY be reduced by its greatest common denominator.

<details><summary>Example: DMT Standard Codes</summary>

For example, the EDID with ID `DMT ID: 45h; Std. 2 Byte Code: (D1, 00)h; CVT 3 Byte Code: (57, 28, 28)h` then the receiver capabilies could contain the following in its constraint sets

```jsonc
[
  {
    "urn:x-nmos:cap:format:grain_rate": {
      "enum": [
        { "numerator": 192250000, "denominator": 3227040 }, // Equals the framte rate of 59.885
        { "numerator": 2403125, "denominator": 40338 }      // When reduced by GCD of 80
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

#### Video Data Block

Video Data Block is defined in [CTA-861][CTA-861] section 7.5.1.

It operates with Video Identification Codes (VICs), each of them is associated with a union of frame width, height and rate and interlace mode. This mapping is defined in [CTA-861][CTA-861] section 4.1.

### Color subsampling

If EDID doesn't have the [CTA-861][CTA-861] Extension Block, color subsampling formats MUST be taken from Base EDID, otherwise from the Extenstion Block.

#### Base EDID

The origin of supported color subsampling formats in Base EDID is the Feature Support in [E-EDID A2][E-EDID] section 3.6.4.

It has one of four possible values:
* RGB 4:4:4
* RGB 4:4:4 & YCbCr 4:4:4
* RGB 4:4:4 & YCbCr 4:2:2
* RGB 4:4:4 & YCbCr 4:4:4 & YCbCr 4:2:2

This value MUST be transformed into `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:color_sampling` with `enum` type values added to each Constraint Set.

#### CTA-861 Extension Block

The origin of supported color subsampling formats in CTA-861 is CTA Extension Header ([CTA-861][CTA-861] section 7.5). Bits 4 and 5 of byte 3 show whether Sink supports `YCbCr 4:2:2` and `YCbCr 4:4:4` respectively in addition to RGB.

`YCbCr 4:2:0` Capability Map Data Block ([CTA-861][CTA-861] section 7.5.11) shows which timings support `YCbCr 4:2:0` in addition to subsampling formats listed in CTA Extension Header.

These values MUST be transformed into `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:color_sampling` with `enum` type value and added to each Constraint Set.

`YCbCr 4:2:0` Video Data Block ([CTA-861][CTA-861] section 7.5.10) marks timings as supporting only `YCbCr 4:2:0`.

Constraint Set associated with these timings MUST have `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:color_sampling` equal to `YCbCr-4:2:0`.

## Audio Receivers

If Basic Audio support bit is active in CTA Extension Header, audio receiver MUST have Receiver Capabilities.

When no descriptors are provided, the cabilities MUST contain:

* `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:media_type` MUST be equal to `audio/L8`
* `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:channel_count` MUST be equal to 2

### Short Audio Descriptors

If there are Short Audio Descriptors (see [CTA-861][CTA-861] section 7.5.2), then each of them MUST be transformed into a Constraint Set.

* `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:media_type` MUST be determined with _Audio Format Code_
  * Linear PCM bit depth MUST be the third Short Audio Descriptors byte
* `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:channel_count` MUST be determined by _Number of Channels_
* `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:sample_rate` MUST be filled with _Sampling Frequencies_
