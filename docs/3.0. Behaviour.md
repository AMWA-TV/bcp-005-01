The purpose of EDID Mapping API is to configure Sender's format according to Receiver Capabilities taken from EDID files and to associated each Receiver with a Destination.

# Senders

`/media-essentials-sets` provides two branches for setting Sender's format: `/media-essentials-sets/all` and `/media-essentials-sets/active`. `all` allows to pass multiple Media Essentials sets to a Sender and let a third-party which controls it choose what exact format to use. `active` lets an API user to pass a single Media Essentials set to specify exact format strictly.

The initial state of `all` and `active` of any Sender is empty. Creating a connection with such Sender via IS-05 doesn't involve NMOS EDID Connection Management.

GET request to `all` and `active` returns the last successfully applied Media Essentials Set.

PUT request to `all` and `active` MUST be validated and if the Device supports the proposed media parameters, it initiates an attempt to reconfigure Device and update according Flow and/or Source values. If success, `all` and `active` GET operation MUST start returning the accepted Set, otherwise an error MUST be returned and nothing changed.

DELETE request to `all` and `active` MUST clear the last successfully applied Set and NMOS EDID Connection Management MUST fall out of use.

`active` takes precedence over `all`.

# Receivers

GET request to `/destinations/all` lists all Destinations connected to the Gateway associated with the Receiver.

`/destinations/active` allows to choose a Destination to be used.
