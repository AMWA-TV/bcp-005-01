## Background

AMWA NMOS specifications provide resources for specifying receiver capabilities of an NMOS device.  Recent extension of these resources allow NMOS Controllers developed for PRO A/V User-Stories to be created.  In particular, these NMOS Controllers include Controllers developed for the AIMS sponsered IPMX set of open standards [IPMX]. 


## Scope

This document provides Best Current Practice guideluines for how to implement mappings of EDID elements onto AMWA IS-04 and IS-EDID-CM resources.  The document also provides guidance on how implementers may use the APIs to achieve some common IPMX type User-Stories and associated use-cases as described in the EDID Connection Management Architecture [EDID-CM-ARCH].


## Definitions


_See also the [NMOS Glossary](https://github.com/AMWA-TV/nmos/wiki/Glossary), and definitions within RFCs._

### EDID 
> Extended Display Identification Data (EDID) is a metadata format for display devices to describe their capabilities to a video source (e.g. graphics card or set-top box). The data format is defined by a standard published by the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA).  For purposes of this BCP, EDID definitions are taken from the E-EDID version 1.4 [E-EDID].



## Mapping from EDID to NMOS Resources

This section is broken down into several subsections that describe recommendations for mapping parts of a target display device's EDID to NMOS Resources.  The following subsections are provided:

> - Mapping of EDID to IS-04 Receiver Caps 
>> - Video Mappings from EDID to IS-04 Receiver Caps
>> - Audio Mappings from EDID to IS-04 Receiver Caps
> - Mapping of EDID to IS-EDID-CM
>> - EDID to IS-EDID-CM Destination Resource
>> - EDID to Essential Media Capabilities
>> - EDID to Raw EDID Format


### Constuction of IS-04 Receiver Caps

This section describes how a display device's capabilities (video and audio) as described by its EDID is mapped by an implementation to the NMOS device's IS-04 Receiver Capabilities.  

#### Video and AUdio Mappings

The following refers to the NMOS Receiver Capabilities Best Current Practices [BCP-004-01]. Paremeter values used are taken from the NMOS Capabilities Parameter Register [NMOS-CAP-REG]

##### Video Mappings

In order that a NMOS device that provides IS-04 Receivers can work with EDID type video devices the device:

> - MUST create one IS-04 Video Receiver for each of the displays associated with the IS-04 Device

> - MUST set the `format` element to the value `urn:x-nmos:format:video`  

> - MUST associate with each IS-04 Receiver a `contraints_set` resource in the IS-04 Receiver's `caps` resource  as described in [BCP-004-1]

> - MUST map at least one of the video modes present by the display device's EDID into the created `contraint_set` with the following elements set:

>> - `urn:x-nmos:cap:meta:enabled` set to `true`.  

>> - `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:grain_rate` set to the refresh rate as taken from the EDID's preferred timing mode for the supported video format. 
>> - `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:frame_width` set to the video frame width as taken from the EDID preferred timing mode.

>> - `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:frame_height` set to the video frame height as taken from the EDID preferred timing mode.

>> - `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:interlace_mode` set to the interlace mode as taken from the EDID standart time block for this supported video mode.

>> - `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:colorspace` set to the colorspace indicated in the EDID Feature Support byte.

>> - `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:color_sampling` set to the set to the color sampling indicated in the EDID Feature Support byte.

>> - `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:component_depth` set to the color bit depth field of the EDID's Video Input definition.

> - MUST map the following elements if present in the EDID

>> - `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:transfer_characteristic` set to the HDR capabilities of the monitor if the EDID contains the optional HDR metadata block.

>> - `urn:x-nmos:cap:meta:preference` 
>>> - set to 100 if the video mode is a preferred mode.  
>>> - set to -100 if the video mode is a non-native mode.  
>>> - set to 0 all others  

> - MUST not add a `contraints_set` for any video mode the device cannot support due to implementation limitations even though the display supports the mode.

> - SHOULD provide a `contraint_sets` entry for each of the video modes supported by the display as provided by the EDID as an individual `contraint_set`on the receiver with parameters set as described above if the mode is supported by the NMOS device.


##### Audio Mappings

In order that a NMOS device that provides Audio Receivers can work with EDID type audio devices the device:

> - MUST create one IS-04 Audio Receiver for each of the displays associated with the IS-04 Device that support audio.

> - MUST set the `format` element to the value `urn:x-nmos:format:audio`  

> - MUST associate with each IS-04 Audio Receiver a `contraints_set` resource in the IS-04 Receiver's `caps` resource  as described in [BCP-004-1]

> - MUST map at least one of the audio modes present by the display device's EDID into a `contraint_set` with the following elements set:

>> - `urn:x-nmos:cap:meta:enabled` set to `true`.  


> - SHOULD provide a `contraint_sets` ent
ry for each of the audio modes supported by the display as provided by the EDID as an individual `contraint_set`.
