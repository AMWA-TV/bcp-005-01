# NMOS EDID Connection Management Architecture

## Introduction

This document presents an architecture for EDID Connection Management operating in an overall NMOS environment. The document provides a list of user stories followed by static architectural elements. These elements are used as the basis to construct UML sequence diagrams for both EDID processing and related IS-04 discovery and IS-05 connection management. The document provides definitions and network topologies related to the architecture.
## Core User Stories

This architecture addresses the following user stories:

1. As a user with a computer that is connected to an HDMI-IPMX gateway (sender) that is connected through a network to an IPMX-HDMI gateway (receiver) plugged into an HDMI monitor with EDID, I would like to be able to plug my computer in and have the best video resolution displayed.

2. As a user with a computer that is connected as above, I'd like to change the resolution of my display to support graphics mode that is lower resolution, so that my graphic intensive program plays back more smoothly.

3. As a ProAV installer I have a set of gateway devices that I send out to my staff, when they set up remote presentations to support our hotel guests. I have the gateway devices configured to auto-connect to each other, as soon as they turn on. The specific monitor or projector (sink) and source are unknown, until they are plugged into the gateway devices. I want my staff to be able to plug a network cable directly into each device (sender and receiver). I have configured these devices to automatically connect to each other when they are directly connected via a network cable... Basically, I want my gateway to work like an HDMI/DisplayPort cable would.

> **Note:** The intent is that the standard supports a configuration that is able to automatically establish a connection when they are directly connected. This is different from a sending device (with a controller service acting as a Broadcast Controller) that would be configured to connect to a specific receiver when it was detected on the network, which is possible to do today.

4. As a ProAV installer, I've added new monitors to the digital signage system that uses IPMX to multicast transport video to my displays. When I plug them in, they negotiate to 4K60, but the rest of the monitors are 1080p. I need the system to play my digital signage content on all of my system's monitors at the best profile supported by all monitors.

5. As a ProAV digital signage installer, I need to colour-match the monitors on my video wall. To do this, I need to read the detailed EDID information, which includes the monitor's colour profile, model number and other such information, which I use in my software for calibration.

6. As a ProAV installer, I have developed some in house EDID software that reads the more detailed data from the monitor, such as serial numbers, manufacture date and colour management information. When I make video walls for customers, I use IPMX AV over IP hardware to deliver content. I would like to be able to retrieve the EDID binary representation from my monitors into my home-built software, so that I can use that information to adjust the monitors and manage my system.

## Definitions

**IPMX**

IPMX (Internet Protocol Media Experience) is a proposed set of open standards and specifications to enable the carriage of compressed and uncompressed video, audio and data over IP networks for the ProAV market. It includes provisions for control, copy protection, connection management and security.

**IPMX Control System**

An application which controls IPMX-compatible NMOS Nodes: discovers them, makes connections etc. An analogue of Broadcast Controller for ProAV use cases.

**IPMX Device Controller**

An entity that configures an IPMX-compatible device and links it with NMOS APIs. In the scope of this document its main purpose is providing EDID Processing API.

**Media Profile**

Media description which describes a format acceptable for all Receivers implied to be a part of a connection. A Media Profile consist of separate parameters required to set up Sender and such IS-04 resources behind it as Source and Flow.

## NMOS Network Topologies

Each of the user stories applies to one or more network topology which describes the NMOS ecosystem. The following network topologies are identified as relating to particular user stories.

* Peer-to-peer: Two media nodes are directly attached with no network. There are no other devices present.
  * Relates to user stories: 1, 2, 3
* Few-to-few: Very limited number of nodes on a network with no dedicated NMOS Registration and Discovery Service (RDS). Device discovery is handled internally by each device on the network.
  * Relates to user stories: 3, 4, 5, 6
* Many-to-Many: Scalable amount of media nodes within a large network. There are dedicated servers and/or applications for each component such as an IPMX Control System and NMOS RDS.
  * Relates to user stories: 4, 5, 6

## Context Level Diagram

> **Note:** This document will use C4 as the method to capture and develop the architecture. For those unfamiliar with C4, the following introduction is highly recommended: <https://c4model.com/>. The quick 5-minute intro is particularly useful, and the associated video provides more details.

Figure 1 shows one context diagram for an IPMX HDMI Gateway System. An IT Staff Person responsible for setting up and administering an IPMX ProAV System uses an external IPMX Control System. It interacts with the IPMX System via RESTful APIs, SNMPV3, ssh, etc. as described in [JT-NM TR-1001-1](https://www.jt-nm.org/tr-1001-1). Note that the architecture presented here does not require a centralized controller (i.e. all NMOS Network Topologies shown above are supported).

## Container Diagram

Figure 2 shows a Container Level diagram. The diagram shows the technologies used for the containers that makeup an IPMX ProAV System. Shown are:

* An IS-04 Registration and Discovery Service
* An IS-06 Network Controller
* An IPMX Gateway Encoder that is an IS-04 Node
* Several IPMX Gateway Decoders that are also IS-04 Nodes.

## Component Diagrams

### IPMX Gateway Encoder Component Diagram

Figure 3 shows a component diagram for an IPMX Gateway Encoder. This diagram illustrates the role of a new architectural component shown in tan. This new component is an IPMX Device Controller that provides a proposed EDID Processing API to support the user stories described above. In addition, the IPMX Device Controller interacts with an HDMI Source by presenting an EDID. It also is responsible for the setup of IS-04 resources as shown in the Sequence Diagrams found below.

| *Figure 3. Component Diagram of an IPMX Gateway Encoder* |

### IPMX Gateway Decoder Component Diagram

Figure 4 shows a component diagram for an IPMX Gateway Decoder. As in the IPMX Gateway Encoder, a new IPMX Device Controller component is present. For an IPMX Gateway Decoder, the IPMX Device Controller is responsible for reading the HDMI Sink's EDID, setting up IS-04 resources including populating IS-04 Receivers with values using [BCP-004-01 Receiver Caps](https://specs.amwa.tv/bcp-004-01).

## Dynamic Aspects of the Architecture

With the above architecture, we can explore more deeply how we can realize the user stories and use cases using sequence diagrams. The document breaks the user stories into EDID processing perspectives and IS-04, IS-05 processing perspectives.

### User Story 1 - Automatic Video Mode Negotiation

> User story 1: As a user with a computer that is connected to an HDMI-IPMX gateway (sender) that is connected through a network to an IPMX-HDMI gateway (receiver) plugged into an HDMI monitor with EDID, I would like to be able to plug my computer in and have the best video resolution displayed.

#### EDID Processing Perspective Encoder Use Case

Let’s choose an initialization use case for the IPMX Gateway Encoder. When an IPMX Gateway Encoder starts up, it should present an EDID to it’s HDMI Sink. Reefrring to Figure 1, we can create a sequence diagram for this use case from the EDID processing perspective, as shown in Figure 5, with associated steps described more fully in Table 1.

| *Figure 5. Sequence Diagram for IPMX Gateway Encoder Setup using EDID* |

Table 1: Sequence Diagram Steps for Figure 5

| Sequence Step | Description | Notes |
| ---  | ---         | ---         |
| 1.Put Media Profiles | The IPMX Control System puts the Media Profiles of required video and audio formats using EDID Processing API. | RAML for the endpoints is provided as a separate specification. |
| 2. Present EDID | The IPMX Device Controller sends the EDID to the HDMI Source using its DDC. | |
| 3. Update Sources, Flows and Senders | The IPMX Device Controller updates the IS-04 Sources, Flows and Senders with details of changed media formats. | |

#### EDID Processing Perspective Decoder Use-Case

The second use-case for the EDID perspective shows an IPMX Gateway Decoder. Figure 6 and Table 2 provide a sequence diagram and associated details for this use-case.

| *Figure 6. Sequence Diagram for IPMX Gateway Decoder Setup using EDID* |

Table 2: Sequence Diagram Steps for Figure 6

| Sequence Step | Description | Notes |
| ---  | ---         | ---         |
| 1. Read EDID | The IPMX Control System reads the EDID from the HDMI Sink. | |
| 2. Parse EDID | The IPMX Device Controller parses the raw EDID file. | During this internal processing, various required JSONs are composed based on schemas for BCP-004-01 Receiver Caps. |
| 3. Update data behind EDID Processing API | The IPMX Device Controller updates data behind EDID Processing API to let its user get updated EDID. | The Sink associated with EDID Processing API includes such information about HDMI Sink as manufacturer name, serial number, etc. |
| 4. Update Receivers | The IPMX Device Controller updates the IS-04 Receivers with updated Receiver Caps. | |

##### NMOS IS-04 IS-05 Perspective

Once the IPMX Encoder and Decoder Gateways have come online and processed the EDID information as shown in Figures 5 and 6 the system is ready to process IS-05 connections.
Figure 7 shows a sequence diagram for setting up a connection between an IPMX Encoder and two IPMX Decoders. In this illustration the ProAV Person requests via an IPMX Control System that an output stream from the IPMX Encoder is sent to two IPMX Decoders. Table 3 describes the steps with details.

| *Figure 7. Sequence Diagram for user story 1 from NMOS Perspective* |

Table 3: Details for Sequence Diagram Steps for Figure 6

| Sequence Step | Description | Notes |
| ---  | ---         | ---         |
| 1. Choose Sender and Receivers | The ProAV Person interacts with the IPMX Control System to choose a set of receivers for a sender. | |
| 2. Get Receiver Caps 1 | The IPMX Control System retrieves the Receiver Caps from the IPMX Decoder 1. | Population of the Receiver Caps has been done as part of EDID processing shown in Figure 6. |
| 3. Get Receiver Caps 2 | The IPMX Control System retrieves the Receiver Caps from the IPMX Decoder 2. | |
| 4. Put Media Profiles | Based on the Receiver Caps Media Profile is created with the best video format available (as required by the user story) or Media Profiles which all the Receivers are capable of consuming. | Create info needed for the IPMX Encoder to update IS-04 resources. |
| 5. Start Stream | The standard IS-05 mechanism is used to start the stream sending on the IPMX Encoder | |
| 6-7. Receive Stream | IS-05 is used to make the connection to IPMX Decoders 1 and 2 | |

### User Story 2 - User Configured Graphics Mode

The section above covered user stories 1, 3, and 4. User story 2 requires an additional step related to HDMI Hot Plug Detect:

> User Story 2. As a user with a computer that is connected as above, I'd like to change the resolution of my display to support graphics mode that is lower resolution, so that my graphic intensive program plays back more smoothly.

Figure 8 shows the EDID processing required for this user story. The IPMX Device Controller is responsible for detecting a change in the video format sent by the HDMI Source by monitoring changes to HDMI InfoFrames. The IPMX Device Controller can either poll the changes in HDMI InfoFrames or cue off of an HDMI Hot Plug Detect event from the HDMI Source.

| *Figure 8. Sequence Diagram for User Configured Graphics Mode* |

Table 4: Details for User Configured Graphics Mode

| Sequence Step | Description | Notes |
| ---  | ---         | ---         |
| 1. Change video format | The computer user changes their video format | Note this would be done using the standard interface for control of an output monitor from Windows, Linux etc. |
| 2. Send changed InfoFrames | The HDMI source changes it’s video mode in response to a user changing it’s video format. | |
| 3. Update Sources, Flows and Senders | The IPMX Device Controller updates the Sources, Flows and Senders resources of IS-04 based on the new video format. | |

#### NMOS IS-04 IS-05 Perspective

From the perspective of setting up an IS-05 connection once the sequences shown in Figure 8 completes the identical steps as shown in Figure 7 apply to realize User-Story 2.

### User Stories 5 and 6 - Detailed EDID Information

User stories 5 and 6 will be treated together since both can be realized using the same mechanism.  The user stories are:

> 5. As a ProAV digital signage installer, I need to colour-match the monitors on my video wall. To do this, I need to read the detailed EDID information, which includes the monitor's colour profile, model number and other such information, which I use in my software for calibration.

> 6. As a ProAV installer, I have developed some in house EDID software that reads the more detailed data from the monitor, such serial numbers, manufacture date and colour management information. When I make video walls for customers, I use IPMX AV over IP hardware to deliver content. I would like to be able to retrieve the EDID binary representation from my monitors into my home-built software, so that I can use that information to adjust the monitors and manage my system.

Since detailed information that is provided by EDID is applicable only to an IPMX Decoder a single use case is described for retrieving EDID information from an IPMX Decoder.

Figure 10 shows a sequence diagram based on Figure 4 for retrieving the information required by user stories 5 and 6. Table 5 provides details on relevant steps.

Table 5: Sequence Diagram Steps for Figure 10

| Sequence Step | Description | Notes |
| ---  | ---         | ---         |
| 1. Read EDID | At startup or on change (Hot Plug Detect) IPMX Device Controller reads the EDID of the HDMI Sink. | |
| 2. Parse EDID | The EDID is parsed and put into a JSON format. | |
| 3. Update Sink | The Sink is updated. | |
| 4. Get Raw EDID | A ProAV User requests the raw EDID of the HDMI Sink associated with Receiver. | |
| 5. Get Raw EDID | The IPMX Control System requests the raw EDID from EDID Processing API. | |
| 6. Get Parsed EDID Info | ProAV Staff requests information from the EDID described in user story 6). | |
| 7. Get Parsed EDID Info | The IPMX Control System requests the raw EDID from EDID Processing API. | This information is provided in JSON format. |
| 8. return | The information described in user story 6 is presented to the ProAV User. | |

## Conclusions

This document has described an Architecture that covers EDID Connection Management user stories provided by phase I of the NMOS EDID Connection management activity. Overall design goals to minimize changes to the existing architecture result in an architecture that adds an additional API. Details of the architecture have been provided using C4 diagrams for Context, Container, and Component Diagrams along with UML Sequence diagrams to illustrate realization of the user stories using the proposed architecture.
